This is a repository for the resources open-sourced with the Explanation Ontology, a general-purpose, semantic representation for user-centered explanations. We contribute the following publicly available artifacts: <strong>Explanations Ontology (EO)</strong> with the <strong>logical formalizations of the different explanation types</strong>, <strong>use cases to demonstrate the applicability of the EO</strong> and <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> to run our competency questions, along with the applicable documentation available on our resource website, to be useful resources for anyone interested in building explanation facilities into their systems. Our resource can be accessed from: https://tetherless-world.github.io/explanation-ontology/

<strong>Links to files for the resources in the repository are</strong>:

<!-- We are aware of issues with PURL, please use this shortened URL pointing to the ontology file until then: https://rb.gy/gsydy0 <br/>
 -->
SPARQL Queries can be accessed from our website and run against the Explanation Ontology to reproduce results that we show at: https://tetherless-world.github.io/explanation-ontology/competencyquestions/#sparql
We ran these queries using the SPARQL plugin on Protege 5.5.0
