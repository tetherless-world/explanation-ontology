<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Explanation Ontology (EO) is an ontology that encodes the system- and user- attributes of explanations that would allow them to be generated computationally. This resource is mainly for system designers to guide them to think about the available AI methods and reasoning tasks within their system that would create explanations to suit the end-users' situation and requirements. EO includes attributes directly included in explanations and others that would help in their process of generation. EO also includes different explanation types that address a range of questions each and their generational needs.</span>
