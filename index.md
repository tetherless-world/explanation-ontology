<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence systems since their conception, with the need for explanations only growing as machine learning models are increasingly used in critical settings such as healthcare. Currently, explanations are often treated as a nice-to-have feature added in a post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specfic explanation types. We design an explanations ontology to formalize the generation of explanations in a machine-readable format, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process. Within our ontology, we support the modeling of different literature-derived explanation types, whose requirements and generational needs were further refined through a requirements gathering exercise conducted with clinicians. Through this ontology, we hope to benefit system designers to include explanation generation facilities in their systems. We evaluate our ontology via competency questions that are inspired by learnings from our clinical requirements gathering exercise and are geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to learn about the best explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in real-time and system design settings.</p>

  <p>We have designed an explanations ontology that captures the aspects of explanations related to their generation from a system's perspective while accounting for factors from an end-user's perspective. Through our modeling of the components involved in the process of explanation generation, we provide a means for system designers to translate their user requirements gathered from user studies to explanations that can be generated by their systems. We depict how our ontology schema can support the modeling of different literature-derived explanation types that help address the diverse needs of user-centric explainability.</p>

<h2 id="modelingabout">Modeling Snippets</h2>
  <p>In this section, we show how our <a href="#ontology">Explanations Ontology</a> can be used to represent the generational needs of different explanation types we identified from our literature review as well as support generation of some examples of explanations we observed or encoded into our prototype AI system that we designed during our requirements gathering session with Duke clinicians. For more details about our requirements gathering sessions or the explanation types itself, refer to our paper submission. In this website we present modeling snippets that use classes and properties from our ontology.</p>

<h3>Modeling of Explanation Types</h3>
  <p>We identified nine explanation types, each with different foci and generational needs, from a literature review we conducted in the computer science and adjacent explanation science domains of philosophy and social sciences. The explanation types are; <a href="#casebased">case based</a>, contextual, contrastive, counterfactual, everyday, scientific, simulation based, statistical and trace based. Utilizing the schema provided by our explanations ontology, we can encode the generational needs of these explanation types as OWL restrictions. Below for each explanation type, we present our description, a prototypical question they can address in a clinical setting and the logical formalization of the explanation type.</p>
  
  <h4> Explanation Types </h4>
  <p class="message">We depict logical formalization of our encoding of the generational needs for explanation type in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">Manchester OWL syntax</a>, in that classes in the OWL restriction are referred to via their labels, and the color highlights are similar to those that can be viewed in Protege. These logical formalizations presented against the <strong>OWL restrictions</strong> label for each explanation type are a representation of the <strong>sufficiency conditions</strong> mentioned before the restrictions.</p>

<h3>Example from Clinical Requirement Gatherings Session</h3>
  <p>We present an example of how our explanations ontology could be used to address a question, "Why Drug B over Drug A?" that clearly requires a contrastive explanation. Given that a contrastive explanation is the most suitable explanation type to address this question, our ontology if loaded into a system can help guide a system designer to locate the <strong>facts</strong> in support of Drug A and <strong>foil</strong> in support/against Drug B. While this is a real question that was asked by one of the clincians to a prototype decision support tool that we built to walk them through a complicated type-2 diabetes patient case, we omit the specific explanation as it is difficult to explain without the entire context of the patient case and the knowledge available to the system. Instead, we present an abstracted up example of a contrastive explanation in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> and in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, we also show how our ontology would have inferred the explanation to be of a contrastive kind if the system had generated two recommendations one based on the facts supporting Drug A and one on the foil ruling out drug B.</p>

<h2>Competency Question</h2>
  <p>We have crafted a set of competency questions which showcase how our explanations ontology can be useful to provide system designers the support they seek when planning to include different explanation types into the system and while deciding what explanation would be best suited for the user's question in real-time given the system's capabilities. We first present a table of our competency question list with the setting they correspond to and answers, and, we then present SPARQL query implementations for these questions.</p>
