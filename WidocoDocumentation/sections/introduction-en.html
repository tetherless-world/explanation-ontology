Explainability has been explored as a focus in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community since its conception, and we have observed that current explainability is tightly coupled with the capabilities and design of the AI methods. AI is being adopted more actively in different areas and more in user-facing domains, with this greater user-adoption there have been review papers [Holzinger et al., 2017] and position statements [Mittelstadt et al., 2019] being authored calling for more diverse forms of explainability that would address a broader range of user questions. While there are several taxonomies being developed to catalog of AI methods capable of generating explanations, they are often model dependent and don't account for user's needs. To address the diverse needs of explainability, we previously conducted a literature review in the computer science, and associated explanation sciences domains of social science and philosophy and found and refined explanation types [Chari S. et al., 2020]. We build off this literature review and a user study in the clinical domain, to design an <strong>Explanation Ontology</strong> that models system and user attributes of explanations to be able to assist system designers to include explanation generation facilities into their systems to meet user's requirements. Hence, within our ontology we provide support for system designers to plan for the AI tasks, methods and different forms of knowledge they would need to support to ensure that their systems are capable of generating explanation types to suit gathered user requirements and in anticipation of new ones. Additionally, we also support the modeling of end user's attributes such as broadly their context and current situation, which would dictate the explanation they would desire. 

Using our Explanation Ontology, we have encoded the generational needs for fifteen literature-derived explanation types and have supported the generation of five exemplar use cases. Currently, we have supported forms of knowledge and class of AI methods (mainly from the IBM AIX-360 toolkit [Arya et al., 2019]) that we found necessary to support the generation of explanation types. However, as we apply our ontology to different use cases we expect the class hiererachy to grow, and we will continue to update the ontology and release updates as we make edits.
